# learningExpress
An attempt to learn express


## Motivation

I have worked a project on ridesharing application using blockchain technology (https://github.com/ishaniGupta27/RydeCoin). The major technology stack for the project was Express.js. That got me interested into learbing express.js from scratch. I am doing a free online course presently from http://campus.codeschool.com/courses/building-blocks-of-express-js. The idea is get basics sorted out and then build a simple application using express.js.
